    <h4>Death</h4>

Long summer afternoon,<br>in dream I had 12 cookies,<br>I ate 10 and put 2 in my pocket.<br>Now that I have woken up, <br>I can't find them.


<h4>Life</h4>

Long winter night, <br>waiting for the last bus I said to myself,<br>"Have I missed the bus?".<br>
Well, there is tomorrow. <br>The bus will return.<br>

 <h4>Love</h4>

I smiled.<br>
